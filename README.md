# web3-user-personas

Welcome to the most comprehensive research resource on Web3 user personas.

What will help bring the next billion users to Web3? Is it one or more of these:

1. Building cool Web3 technologies that Web3 wizards come up with?

2. Solving real user pain points that can be appropriately and adequately addressed
with Web3 solutions?

3. Aligning Web3 teams ( builders, designers, content ) with user and product priorities.

If your answer does not include 2. and 3. above, you'd benefit deely by digging into this analysis.

A deeper understanding of Web3 users and a cohesive product strategy is a must if you are a builder, designer or content creator in Web3. That requires continuously monitoring and tracking these metrics:

- Who is currently using Web3 solutions powered by blockchain and cryptography?

- What is the big picture around Web3? How do users of wallets, security tools,
dApps (trading, NFTs, coins, interoperability, others) perceive Web3?

- What drives their adoption of these solutions?

- What are the emerging Web3 and Web4 blue skies and regulation driven demands that seek technology innovations?

This study analyzes 15 Web3 user personas using data available via published Web3 reports, Web3 trailblazers online, and solutions research.

It highlights behaviors, engagement hooks, technology affinity, mindsets, motivations, and core needs. Feel free to use these templates to validate and formulate a well-rounded and informed action plan for your Web3 solution strategy, its design, messaging and target the target persona more effectively and scale onboarding.


## Limitations

Public data does not contain the following details and has limited information in certain contexts:

* Geographic granularity insights
* Web3-native behaviors - does not cover NFT trading, governance participation in depth
* Real user count versus volume
