# web3-user-personas

Welcome to Web3 user personas, a comprehensive research into Web3 denizens transitioning into Web4!

## Overview

This project delivers user [persona template](https://web3-user-personas.netlify.app/personas/#persona-template) across 5 distinct Web3 archetypes
and [15 different user personas](https://web3-user-personas.netlify.app/personas/#persona-types).

It synthesizes insights from reputable surveys, industry reports, publications,
 and research from leading Web3 innovators. The study uncovers each persona’s 
 behaviors, engagement triggers, technology preferences, mindset, motivations, 
 and core needs.

Use these templates to inform and validate your Web3 strategy — from product 
design and feature prioritization to messaging and scalable user acquisition.

## Why Web3 Personas?

*Want to onboard the next billion users to Web3?*

Ask yourself what will truly get us there:

* 1. Shipping cool tech for the sake of tech?
* 2. Solving real user pain points with Web3 capabilities?
* 3. Aligning builders, designers, and content teams around user-first priorities?

If your answer doesn’t include **#2 and #3**, this research is your wake-up call. 

Real growth requires more than just innovation. It takes a deep understanding
of the people we’re building for — their mindset, motivations, frustrations, 
behavior patterns, tech comfort, and evolving expectations.

If you’re a builder, designer, or content creator in Web3, mastering user personas
isn’t optional. It is how you stay aligned with:

* Who is using blockchain-powered products and why
* Their pain points, motivations, and technical affinity
* The fast-shifting Web3 landscape — today, next month, next quarter
* Adoption narratives shaping developer and user perception across infra, wallets, security, trading, NFTs, coins, interoperability and beyond
* The horizon demands that are already emerging (DeFAI, RegTech, Web4, etc.)

*Persona insights = clarity, alignment, and faster onboarding at scale.*

Check it out, seriously. 

*Ignore these insights and you’re building in a vacuum.*
Visit this study before you ideate, pitch, build, design, or market your next Web3 product.
And don’t just reference it once — stay aligned with it regularly. Share your unique
insights and help keep these personas alive and accurate. See the contribution 
section for details.

## Limitations

Public data does not contain the following details and has limited information in certain contexts:

* Geographic granularity insights
* Web3-native behaviors - does not cover NFT trading, governance participation in depth
* Real user count versus volume
* Claude, Gemini, Grok and ChatGPT data and training model limitations
* Absence of any focussed, comprehensive Web3 user persona research from the industry
