# web3-user-personas

What will help bring the next billion users to Web3?

1. Building cool Web3 technologies that Web3 wizards come up with?

2. Solving real user pain points that can be appropriately and adequately addressed
with Web3 solutions?

3. Aligning Web3 teams ( builders, designers, content ) with user and product priorities.

If your answer does not include 2. and 3. above, you must dig in deeper and use this study.

A deeper understanding of Web3 users and a cohesive product strategy is a must if you are a builder, designer or content creator in Web3.

- Who is currently using Web3 solutions powered by blockchain and cryptography?

- What is the big picture around Web3? How do users of wallets, security tools,
dApps (trading, NFTs, coins, interoperability, others) perceive Web3?

- What drives their adoption of these solutions?

This study analyzes 15 Web3 user personas using data available via published Web3 reports and research.

It highlights behaviors, engagement hooks, technology affinity, mindsets, motivations, and core needs.
Use these to inform your product strategy, formulate an action plan to onboard the right audience and scale adoption.

## Limitations

Public data does not contain the following details and has limited information in certain contexts:

* Geographic granularity
* Web3-native behaviors - does not cover NFT trading, governance participation in depth
* Real user count versus volume
