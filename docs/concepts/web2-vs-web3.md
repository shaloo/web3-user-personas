# Web2 vs. Web3

Web3 user personas differ greatly from typical Web2 ones. Four key factors explain these differences:

* Data ownership
* User Identity
* Economics
* Interaction
* Privacy, Transparency, Trust

tl;dr

| Factors | Web2 | Web3 |
| :---    | :--- | :--- |
| Data Ownership: Control | Providers, Platforms, Orgs | Users |
| User Identity: Empowerment  | Fragmented, Providers, Platforms | Users |
| Economics: Driving Force | Providers, Platforms, Orgs | DAOs, Users |
| Privacy, Transparency, Trust: PoV | Providers, Platforms, Orgs | Users |


## Data ownership

**Control:** *Organizations vs. Users*

In Web2, user’s data is owned by the service providers and the centralized platform, infrastructure organizations. In Web3, users own the data and digital assets.This ensures complete privacy to the user.

## Identity

**Empowerment**:** *Fragmented vs. Self-sovereign*

Unlike Web2 where centralized authentication providers enable user identity, in Web3 users own their identity, self-sovereign identities (SSI). These identities are typically wallet addresses or secure private keys used to sign blockchain transactions.

## Economics

**Driving force:** *Organizations vs. Users*

In Web2, users have little or no role in monetizing interactions. In Web3, users actively shape economic models. They earn and use digital assets like tokens, NFTs, and participate in staking or DAO voting.

## Interactions

**Model:**  *Hub and spoke vs. Peer to Peer, Permissioned vs. permissionless*

In Web2, users rarely interact directly with each other. Organizations control and enable most user interactions.

## Privacy, Transparency, Trust

**PoV:** *Organizations vs. users*

Web3 user data privacy, interaction transparency creates trust in the system whereas in Web2 user is forced to trust the organization offering service for data privacy. In Web2, privacy, transparency and trust are governed by the organization not the users. Cryptographic data security provides safer, uncensored data storage and access environments though prone to hacks and scams.
