# Personas

Persona is an abstraction of an individual.

They refer to semi-fictional profiles that represent an ideal user for a product or service.


In Web3, user personas are often constructed using two types of data:

* Off-chain traits (such as demographics and interests)
* On-chain behavior (wallet activity and transaction history)

Web3 frequently encounters challenges in providing optimal user experiences.

Comprehending a product’s target user personas aids builders in prioritizing features. 
They can refine messaging, enhance onboarding, and establish more robust communities with 
a deeper understanding of the user and fostering user empathy.

Familiarize yourself with the key 
aspects of user personas, the factors that influence user behavior, and the potential impact 
of user behavior on a product’s viability.

* What drives user personas, what engages or disengages them?
* How alignment with user behavior can impact product's viability and
  adoption?
* Why understanding user personas is critical when developing new
  technology or solutions for Web3?

## Limitations

Knowing users is important for effective engagement. Limiting Web3 persona to on-chain
behavior, anecdotal data or gut-based insights can ruin product/solution acceptance 
chances in the real world.

Cognitive biases and conjunctive fallacies can ruin decision making.

The personas can help us to really think about the problems and needs of various groups of users.
However we need to be extra careful that we don’t get caught up in who we may think these personas 
actually represent.

*Note that a persona is not a real person.*

Make sure, you hypothesize but then test the hypothesis. Examine the actual numbers of real users
who would be impacted by a particular product feature or navigational tweak in the documentation
before deciding on it.
