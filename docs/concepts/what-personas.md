# Personas

Personas are semi-fictional profiles that represent ideal Web3 users.

These are often built using two types of data:

* Off-chain traits (like demographics and interests)
* On-chain behavior (wallet activity, transaction history)

Web3 often struggles with poor user experiences. Understanding your target personas helps you prioritize features, refine messaging, improve onboarding, and build stronger communities.

Focus on users to navigate Web3’s complexity and build teams that create products for mass adoption.
