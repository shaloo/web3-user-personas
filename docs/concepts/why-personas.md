## Why Personas?

The mortality rate of new offerings and startups is above 90%.
Research suggests that the topmost (42%) cause of failure is
the lack of product‑market fit. One root cause: not
knowing the target user persona.

Not knowing the target user means lacking clarity about:

* Who the customers/users actually are?
* What problems they face?
* How they currently solve those problems?
* What they're willing to pay for?

Very few can predict future customer needs and fund end-to-end bets.
Most teams cannot and should not rely on intuition alone.

For everyone else, avoid a common trap.
Engineers often fall in love with solutions before understanding the user problem.

### Gaining Traction

Successful startups more often than not first invest time and resources
to deeply understand users before jumpting into creating solutions.
It is a necessary but not a sufficient predictor of a product's success.

Staying aligned with users’ needs benefits product, design, marketing, and sales.
It creates cross‑functional alignment that is crucial for success.

Several factors and their complex interplay drive Web3 adoption. Adoption varies
depending upon the demography, technology literacy, economic necessity, local governing
laws and social influences. 

Being aware of these vital adoption factors in the context of target user personas,
their mindset, motivation and must-have requirements can inform and fine tune Web3
solution building, designing and communication efforts towards better chances of gaining
traction and eventual adoption and success.

## Factors Driving Adoption

Web3 adoption [adoption studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44257-024-00018-x#Abs1)
and the latest [worldwide adoption reports](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2025-global-crypto-adoption-index/) point towards a higher awareness and ownership of cryptocurrencies among young, educated males with proficient computer skills in both developed and developing nations.

Following is a list of primary factors that impact Web3 solution adoption in the context of some popular
Web3 use cases:

| Use Case | Vital Factors |
| :--- | :--- |
| Wallet Usage | Trust, Usability |
| Investment Purpose | Social influence, Perceived usefulness and risk, Financial literacy |
| Transferring Value | Security and risk perception, Performance and effort expectancy, Social influence |
| Other Use cases | Trialability, Transparency, Cost efficiency | 

## User Persona Tenets

In this research, you will find various Web3 user persona archetypes and what drives them.
Following are the most basic and fundamental tenets that **drive** any user persona:

1. Mindset
2. Motivation
3. Must-Have

These key tenets drive the *Who, What, Why, Where, When and How*
of any products usage.

Let’s explore how each tenet shapes product usage, guides behavior,
and impacts product success.

### Mindset

A user's mindset refers to general attitude, assumptions, and beliefs 
about oneself, others, and the world. These shape how a user thinks,
feels, and behaves.  Mindset works as a mental filter or frame of 
reference, influencing one's perceptions and choices. It can
evolve over time depending upon user's motivation.

**Usage:** Understanding user's mindset informs who is using the product, how
they are inclined to use it and what is the preferred usage pattern. Who informs
the decision about the level of the audience. Whether they know more about
the domain than the technology builders or nothing at all about what it can
do for them. This detail informs whether users need to be provided basic 
information to enable product usage or will too much basic information come
in the way of product adoption.

**Governs:** Mindset governs product usage patterns, how a user interacts
with the product and their preferred mode of information processing. For example,
users with fixed mindsets may not be tolerant to a steep learning curve unlike
those with a growth mindset.

**Influences:** Mindset can influence how a product is adopted, what features
are preferred or expected and what kind of learning approach could click for
a new product or feature. This not only informs the builders and designers
but also product documentation and marketing.

### Motivation

Motivation is the intrinsic or extrinsic force that can drive human behavior.
It is at the root of why people initiate, continue, or end actions to achieve a goal.

**Usage:** Understanding user's motivation informs why they
use a feature or product, what kind of pain points it solves and where or in what
context a product or feature is needed. For example, the answer to where could 
provide information about whether is it something that will be
used through a desktop or mostly via a mobile device?

**Governs:** Motivation governs the purpose or goal of a product's usage, the 
frequency of use and the perceived value and expectations in terms of
ease of use, performance and effectiveness.

**Influences:** User's motivation influences a products engagement levels,
retention patterns and how sensitive they may be to a new use model or learning
curve.

### Must-Have

Must-Have refers to degree of the user's need or requirement and hence the 
timelines or window of opportunity that builders can leverage.

**Usage:** Understanding the must-have aspect of a user's persona helps answer
the when or the timing aspect of any product's engineering and usage.

**Governs:** The must-have tenet governs the urgency and willingness to pay for
a product or a feature. 

**Influences:** Understanding the must-have user persona tenet can impact the 
user's interest level in a product or a new feature. It can help align the 
product roadmap and provide guidance on the available time window.
Builders can prioritizing the features that align with must-haves. It also influences the speed of user
onboarding and hence the time and effort required for streamlining or 
simplifying onboarding.
