The mortality rate of new offerings and startups is above 90%.
Research suggests that the topmost cause of failure (42%) is
the lack of product‑market fit. 

**One root cause:**  *Not knowing or catering to the target user persona.*

Not knowing the target user means lacking clarity about:

* Who the customers/users actually are?
* What problems they face?
* How they currently solve those problems?
* What they're willing to pay for?

Very few can predict future customer needs and fund end-to-end bets.
Most teams cannot and should not rely on intuition alone.

For everyone else, avoid a common trap.
Engineers often fall in love with solutions before understanding the user problem.

## Gaining Traction

Most successful startups invest time and resources in understanding their target 
users. They do this before implementing solutions. This is a necessary step, but 
it is not enough. Understanding users alone does not guarantee adequate product 
traction.

Staying aligned with users’ needs benefits product, design, marketing, and sales.
It creates cross‑functional alignment that is crucial for success.

Web3 adoption is driven by the interplay of several complex factors. Adoption level and the rate of adoption varies depending upon the demography, technology literacy, economic necessity, local governing laws, and social influences.

Being aware of these vital adoption factors in the context of target user personas,
their mindset, motivation and must-have requirements can inform and fine tune Web3
solution building, designing and communication efforts towards better chances of gaining
traction and eventual adoption and success.
