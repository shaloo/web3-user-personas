## Background

The Web3 Personas project emerged from my experiences in buildling, refining,
 pivoting and writing about Web3 infrastructure software since 2022.

Over the years, through conversations with Web3 thinkers, developers, and builders, 
several of us have come to the realizion that the lack of mass adoption of Web3
has created an intriguing Web3 conundrum.

The fundamental blockchain technology premise of decentralization and privacy was intended 
for individual empowerment and ownership. But the technology behind Web3 is complex, poorly scaled, 
and unusable by the masses today. In a way, Web3 prevents itself from attracting the very masses 
that it was designed to serve.

You too may have witnessed several examples of dedicated and sincere builders constructing remarkable Web3 technologies and 
infrastructures for the next million users, only to face challenges in gaining traction 
or even becoming visible to the faceless Web3 community. This is a colossal waste of effort and 
intellect. If only venture capitalists and builders were clear about their vision and the 
target audience for their products, or even their evolving direction, things could be different.

It is time to make a difference and make a concentrated effort in this direction. 
This project aims to highlight the significance of deeply understanding Web3 user personas 
in developing products that resonate with their intended users. User empathy plays a crucial 
role in enhancing product onboarding ease. A fast and seamless onboarding process fosters trust, 
while continuous understanding of user behavior and needs aligns products with their true purpose, 
leading to product stickiness and momentum.

As with most evolving fields, Web3 is evolving and improving. These insights are not static but 
serve as a valuable starter framework for aligning product visions with the target audience. 
This is an attempt to encourage the wider Web3 buidler community to create its own unique product user persona template and refine it based on 
product specific understanding and its market fit. Early beta adopters can be a valuable 
source of user persona research. 

Any [[contributions|suggestions, feedback, or contributions]] you have to make to enhance this project are welcome.
