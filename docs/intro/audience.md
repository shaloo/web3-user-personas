# Audience

Are you building the future of decentralized tech?

**Great.**

*Web3 Builders & Designers*, you are the target audience for this project.

Use this research to zoom in, sharpen your focus, and ship features that matter. 
[Web3 Personas](../personas/index.md) is a deep dive into real users — what drives them,
how they behave, and what keeps them engaged.

Gain clarity on:

* Which pain points truly need solving?
* UX must-haves that users won’t compromise on
* Technical expectations across the Web3 stack
* Typical usage patterns in decentralized apps

Apply these insights to shape your own [[persona-archetypes#persona-template|persona templates]]^*^ and build Web3 products that users genuinely want.

^*^*Your template could be an informed mix of one or more Web3 user persona archetypes.*
