## Persona Template

Each Web3 user persona is analyzed using the following categories and an action plan on how best to target them for Web3 offerings is presented towards the end. Note this is an evolving model based on limited public reports and user-behavior data on-chain and otherwise.

### Tarot Card

We have personified each Web3 user persona with a Tarot Card that best encapsulates their mindset, motivation and behaviors. Designers are visual folks. Communicators can align messaging better with a persona's synopsis that matches their mental model. For builders, this is just to provide some visual cues and fun facts that help them remember who they are building for.

We do not have the best possible Tarot card visuals yet. In the initial version of the study, we have used open source tooling to let AI generate a first cut. In the subsequent revisions, we plan to get useful constructive feedback from designers and make these visual cues more attention worthy and something to lighten the mood!
