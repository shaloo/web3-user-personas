## Persona Template

This study maps and analyzes each Web3 user persona using core persona building blocks. An action plan is then suggested based on the insights inferred from that analysis.

This persona template is an evolving model. It draws on publicly available Web3 usage reports. It also incorporates on-chain and off-chain user-behavior research, along with fast-shifting media narratives.

Use this structure as the foundation for your own product persona template. Then keep your product features, design approach, and communication style consistently aligned with the needs of your target persona.

The core building blocks of the template are:

- [Tarot Card](#tarot-card)
- [tl;dr](tl-dr)
- [Characteristics](#characteristics)
- [Behavior Patterns](#behavior-patterns)
- [Pain Points](#pain-points)
- [Engagement Hooks](#engagement-hooks)
- [Primary Platforms](#primary-platforms)
- [Tech Affinity](#tech-affinity)
- [How to Target?](#how-to-target)
- [Action Plan](#action-plan)
- [See Also](#see-also)

### Tarot Card

We have personified each Web3 user persona with a Tarot Card and a rhyming identity that best encapsulates their mindset, motivation and behaviors. Designers are visual folks. Communicators can align messaging better with a persona's synopsis that matches their mental model. For builders, this is just to provide some visual cues and fun facts that help them remember who they are building for.

We do not have the best possible Tarot card visuals yet. In the initial version of the study, we have used open source tooling to let AI generate a first cut. In the subsequent revisions, we plan to get useful constructive feedback from designers and make these visual cues more attention worthy and something to lighten the mood!

### tl;dr

This section gives decision-makers a quick, high-level view of the personas.
Use this to quickly align on product, design, and marketing strategies before sign-off.

### Characteristics

Characteristics of a user define traits such as their values, beliefs and thinking patterns. These are not directly visible but inferred via observed behavior. Characteristics answer the 'Who' and 'Why' questions about a user. They uniquely identify, differentiate, and influence the user's mindset and motivations.

*Example: A person who is intelligent, naturally curious, rebellious and risk taking.*

### Behavior Patterns

Behavior of a user refers to the observable action or reaction in a specific situation or use case related to a Web3 product or solution. It answers the 'What users do?' question. Note that the characteristics of a user are mostly constant but the behavior may change depending upon the situation. Behavior patterns inform product feature selection, prioritization, design decisions, and messaging tactics.

*Example: Betting on high risk projects that are not regulated, or defying traditional norms. In case of a market drop or any unforeseen financial event, this behavior may change temporarily but the underlying character may not change in the long run.*


### Pain Points

Pain points are a part of a Web3 usage process or the underlying system that causes onboarding friction, usage problems or obstructions in utilizing an offering. In Web3 there are several pain points but your target user may only experience a handful or have their own unique ones depending upon the use case and the technology involved. 

For example:

* complex onboarding
* poor UX, DX
* a steep learning curve
* confusing jargon
* security risks (high-profile hacks)
* lack of clear metrics for measuring ROI
* scalability
* high transaction fees (gas costs)
* regulatory uncertainty
* integration of off-chain information, tech stacks
* challenges in building and managing decentralized teams

Identifying the key pain points early on can help align product priorities and build efficiently towards a more acceptable product. An acceptable product is one that qualifies as a minimum saleable product (MSP), not just a viable product (MVP).

### Engagement Hooks

In today’s attention economy, an engagement hook is essential to capture the interest of prospective users. It forms a product’s first impression, sparks curiosity, and motivates the audience to try it.

Web3 user personas respond to distinct engagement hooks as per their behavior, affinities, and tendencies. These shape how a new product is received and whether it retains users over time. Technical marketers can use these insights to time and tailor product messaging and content for stronger traction.

### Primary Platforms

Primary platforms are the channels where a Web3 persona engages.

These may include domain or interest-specific communities. Users and influencers share insights there that shape product design and communication strategy for better reach.

### Tech Affinity

Tech Affinity maps the specific Web3 technologies and solutions that resonate with each persona. It highlights the tools and features distinct to each user type. For example:

* **For Power Users:** Deliver efficiency, advanced integrations, and technical depth.

* **For Newcomers:** Focus on guardrails for successful onboarding without overwhelming. Use guided onboarding and simplified education that reduces friction.

Aligning with a persona's tech affinity helps product builders by providing a strategic blueprint for resource allocation, feature prioritization, and user experience (UX) design. Essentially, it ensures the product is built on the right infrastructure and offers the right level of complexity for its target user.

### How to Target?

This section outlines the [[persona-tenets|key tenets]] of each persona in terms of their mindset, motivations, and must-haves. These factors shape user behavior and directly influence product adoption patterns.

Understanding each persona's key tenets must inform and drive your product design, website, and documentation strategy.

* Understand and leverage their mindset.
* Tap into their motivation.
* Deliver on their must-have requirements to address them at priority.

### Action Plan

Action Plan serves as your blueprint for execution:

* **Strategy:** Defines the specific design philosophies, communication styles, and feature sets for each persona.

* **Alignment:** Ensures your roadmap connects directly with the user's core tenets and needs.

Use this framework to ground your product decisions, ensuring they align with the user's core tenets while validating against your own research.
