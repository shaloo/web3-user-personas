# Web3 User Personas

Web3 user personas are unique and very different from those in Web2.
This is largely due to how Web3 operates.

key archetypes. Besides the primary archtypes, based on user behavior 
there are several secondary persona types.

## Persona Template

Each Web3 user persona is analyzed using the following categories and an action plan on how best to target them for Web3 offerings is presented towards the end. Note this is an evolving model based on limited public reports and user-behavior data on-chain and otherwise.

### Tarot Card

We have personified each Web3 user persona with a Tarot Card that best encapsulates their mindset, motivation and behaviors. Designers are visual folks. Communicators can align messaging better with a persona's synopsis that matches their mental model. For builders, this is just to provide some visual cues and fun facts that help them remember who they are building for.

We do not have the best possible Tarot card visuals yet. In the initial version of the study, we have used open source tooling to let AI generate a first cut. In the subsequent revisions, we plan to get useful constructive feedback from designers and make these visual cues more attention worthy and something to lighten the mood!

### Engagement Hooks

Each Web3 user persona has their own special engagement hooks or behavior affinities, tendencies that impact how they adopt or learn about new products and stay hooked. Technical marketeers can use these insights to align and time the product messaging and content.

### Primary Platforms

### Tech Affinity

 The tech affinity section highlights the Web3 technologies, features, and solutions each persona cares about. Many are tech-savvy, so products should respect their time with clear know-how and smooth integrations.
For newcomers or less tech-focused personas, prioritize education and guided onboarding — without overwhelming them — to help them achieve their real-world goals.
