# 1. DeFi Degen: Crypto Carl

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- *Fearlessly embarking on risky adventures with bold optimism to explore.* ![DeFi Degen (Tarot: The Fool)](../img/1_defi_degen.webp)

- ## tl;dr

    DeFi Degens have a extreme-risk mindset. They chase the highest yields using high-risk strategies. Mostly males in 25-35 age group, retail investors with primary user base in North America and largest growth volumes in Asia.

    * Fast movers, pushing the boundaries for trades and gains, appear as rash to traditional finance folks.

    * Work with significant capital towards yield farming (APY), memecoin snapping, leverage trading, and cross-chain arbitrage. Actively use platforms that enable flash loans, yield aggregators, trading bots, perpetuals, and security tools for rug pull monitoring. Deal with [slow settlements on blockchain](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/why-stablecoins-deserve-faster-blockchain-settlements-and-how-theyre-getting-there-213079) even today.

    * Believe in the core values of anonymity, decentralization, and asymmetric bets.

    * Willing to experiment and try new solutions to explore. Hang out on Telegram/Discord alpha groups, value influencer endorsements, and transparent community sharing of win/losses.

    * Driven by exponential returns, early mover advantage, social status, and financial independence from traditional systems. Provide much needed liquidity and visibility to early stage projects.

    * Require real-time price feeds with instant execution, multi-chain wallet integration, smart contract audit indicators, portfolio tracking with APY indicators optimizing returns, social signals indicating community activity, and automated stop-loss or risk management as they often fail to set controls in the hurry to act.

    * Respond well to speed-optimized mobile first designs, one-click execution, comprehensive dashboard, and concise documentation.

## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Mobile first design, speed over efficiency, comprehensive dashboards with risk alerts, concise and brief documentation, workflow notes.
* **Communication Style:** Engage with crypto native terminology, provide clear risk warnings. Focus on transparency, social proofs (audits) and community signals.
* **Product Features:** Identify relevant technology affinity areas applicable in the context and address must-haves. Ensure fast transaction flows, user-friendly interface for yields, APY and other benefit indicators, integrate social features that enable them to engage with the community and see what others are doing, utilizing for better results.
