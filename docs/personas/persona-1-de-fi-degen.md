## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Mobile first design, speed over efficiency, comprehensive dashboards with risk alerts, concise and brief documentation, workflow notes.
* **Communication Style:** Engage with crypto native terminology, provide clear risk warnings. Focus on transparency, social proofs (audits) and community signals.
* **Product Features:** Identify relevant technology affinity areas applicable in the context and address must-haves. Ensure fast transaction flows, easy to use yield, APY and other benefit indicators, integrate social features that enable them to engage with the community and see what others are doing, utilizing for better results.
