-   :material-vector-difference: __Institutional Investor Mindset__

    ---

    * *Risk-first, Compliance-centric Orientation:* Prefer regulatory vehicles for investments, risk averse with high appetite for calculated exposure. Prioritize regulatory compliance over potential returns, work with established, regulated entities, and demand clear legal framework before significant deployment of funds.
    * *Diversification-driven:* Asymmetric returns and hedging, low correlation portfolio spread, ability to address with GenZ and alpha client demands. Crypto is third category asset after private and public funds. Need to balance fiduciary duties with innovative investment opportunities.
    * *Strategic Patience, Operational Rigor:* Most hold positions awaiting optimal entry, with an eye towards [six-month allocations](https://www.sygnum.com/news/high-risk-appetite-and-long-term-confidence-drives-57-of-institutional-investors-to-raise-crypto-allocations-sygnum-future-finance-survey/). Decisions are routed through formal committees, due diligence processes, RFPs for vendors and SLA reviews.
    * *Vendor & Audit Conscious:* Trust is earned via audited processes (SOC reports), reputable counterparties, and institutional-grade transparency (wallet attestations, proof of reserves [where applicable](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/assets/6th-annual-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report.pdf)).
    * *Innovation with Guardrails:* Attracted to digital assets as an "investment in innovative technology" but [demand](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/g/files/djuvja3256/files/acquiadam/June%202024%20Institutional%20Investors%20Digital%20Asset%20Survey%20-%20Key%20Findings%20%2805.29%29.pdf) that this innovation be wrapped in the security and structure of traditional finance (TradFi). Prefer traditional finance integration and value established relationships with traditional finance providers.

## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** For transparency and explicability, UI must expose provenance, signer attestations and validations. Prioritize risk control with clear, well-labeled warnings, configurable limit orders, and comprehensive, real-time reporting dashboards that show regulatory status, counterparty risk, and portfolio volatility. Customizable dashboards that show consolidated exposures, compliance flags, audit trails, role-based access controls and multi-user workflows (committee approvals). Focus on Developer Experience (DX). Provide robust, high-performance APIs and documentation for seamless integration into existing financial infrastructure, minimizing the need for manual data entry or specialized Web3 knowledge. For CX, provide white-glove service with dedicated account managers who understand finance, rapid technical support, and consultative services on regulatory compliance and asset allocation.
* **Communication Style:** Institutional investors expect information density, detailed technical/legal whitepapers and third-party audit reports. Communication should be distributed through their preferred channels like specialized research reports, white papers, and webinars. Establish credibility by publishing original, high-quality research and reports with global financial institutions that can quantify risks and benefits. Do not use marketing hype but focus on using language like "governance framework," "institutional-grade custody," and "risk-adjusted returns." Share regular insights from industry thought leaders, timely regulatory updates.
* **Product Features:** Multi-Jurisdictional reporting with multi-monitor, granular, downloadable reports covering tax, accounting, and regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions. Built-in features for automated AML/KYC checks, configurable geo-fencing for cross-border operations, and mandatory transaction monitoring. Multi-sig vault controls. Offer regulated wrapper and integration services that provide exposure to digital assets without requiring the institution to handle the underlying assets directly. Provide modular integration with pluggable APIs for reporting, accounting systems, custody connectors, and compliance workflows (so institutions can integrate with internal systems). Provide region-specific legal and regulatory guidance. Real-time event notification systems, Webhooks integration, SDKs for custom integration, and sandbox environments for testing.
