    - Discord dev channels
    - Twitter/X
    - GPU and AI conferences (ETHDenver, NVIDIA GTC, KubeCon)

- ## Tech Affinity

    - Solutions that enable single click deployment of self-evolving personalized portfolio trading bots that stay ahead of market trends, optimize returns by executing hundreds of orders 24/7 (Bitsgap AI assistant, Cryptohopper, Pionex, Gunbot, Kryll, Dash2Trade, and Learn2Trade)
    - Decentralized compute marketplaces (GPU/CPU)
    - Compute-to-Data & data marketplaces (privacy-preserving data access)
    - On-chain agents & agent wallets / autonomous agents
    - Decentralized AI coordination networks / model marketplaces
    - AI-centric tokens & incentive layers, NFTs & generative AI pipelines (content)
    - Privacy-preserving computation (FHE, MPC, TEEs)

## How to Target?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-vector-difference: __AI + Crypto Wiz Mindset__

    ---

    * *Sovereignty-first, Privacy-aware:* Prefers owning AI models/computations/data, avoiding centralized provider lock-in; actively seek privacy-preserving tech (compute-to-data, FHE)
    * *AI as a Strategy, Efficiency & Optimization Maximalist:* Likes to delegate to AI agents that autonomously execute strategies (trading, rebalancing, paying bills) with verifiable reasoning
    * *Builder, experimenter:* Early adopter of convergent technologies (Virtuals Protocol), explores composable decentralized compute, data tokens, smart contracts with verifiable automation, AI-powered blockchain projects transforming self-learning, autonomous systems revolutionizing trading, DeFi, governance, and blockchain interactions
    * *Token Native:* Expects tokens to align incentives (pay, stake, reward trainers)
    * *Demands verifiability, metrics:* Skeptical of hype, workflows mix finance and ML, demands verifiable backtests and reasoning, transparent model metrics, and provable computation 

-   :material-brain: __AI + Crypto Wiz Motivation__

    ---

    * *Grow money 24x7:* Motivated to use AI to maximize and optimize trading yields via automated but customizable strategies
    * *Privacy:* Use privacy tech (FHE, compute-to-data) to prevent large providers from exploiting models/data
    * *Creatively Curious:* Likes to experiment with generative art, programmable NFTs, mutable scarcity and provenance, agentic economy
    * *Ownership:* Want to be compensated for training data, models, and compute
    * *Democratizing Access to Institutional-Grade Tools:* Motivated by DeFAI promises of leveraging expert-developed algorithms to manage crypto portfolios across all market conditions, providing institutional-grade quantitative strategies to individual investors (StoicAI)
    * *Future-Proofing Through Web4.0 Infrastructure:* Growth potential of global Web 4.0 and virtual worlds market, known as Web 4.0, ($27 billion in 2022 to over $800 billion by 2030), first mover advantage with this shift towards a decentralized, autonomous AI-driven ecosystems where intelligent agents interact, transact, and self-govern.

-   :material-rocket-launch: __AI + Crypto Wiz Must-Have__

    ---

    * Low learning curve when using but comprehensive UX that can handle key/custody, agent policy, and safety controls
    * API-first architecture, strategy builder, real-time data feeds for customizable model and agent integration DX, plug-ability, and composability
    * Privacy-preserving compute (FHE/MPC/TEEs), compute-to-data workflows
    * Reliable, low-latency decentralized compute with SLAs
    * Stable inference/training performance and GPU availability
    * Tokenized incentives (payments, staking, revenue shares)
    * Multi-chain, cross-platform integration, interoperability (L1/L2, oracle support, real-time data feeds) for privacy-preserving DeFi transactions
    * Marketplace for selling/buying AI bots
    * Automatic risk management and security monitoring
    * Natural language interfaces (text message triggered transaction), verifiable on-chain execution 

</div>

## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Data heavy UX but insightful dashboards with customizable visualizations, backtest graphs, logs, and health metrics. Modular building DX blocks (compute, data, tokens) and an SDK so builders wire up agents quickly, low friction onboarding, and one click deployment.
* **Communication Style:** Reach via research and active dev channels across GitHub, DevRel content, Discord, specialized forums, and technical webinars. Use notebooks, backtest reproducible examples, and compute cost breakdowns to build trust. Resonate with sovereignty mindset with protocol grants, hackathons, and data/model monetization case studies, establish thought leaderships on privacy and ethics by publishing whitepapers, hosting AMAs about FHE, privacy and agent governance. AI focused crypto channels, performance driven marketing approach, educational content on automation and Web 4.0, integrate with industry consortiums (Fetch.ai partnered with Bosch to form a consortium for industrial applications of AI agents, while SingularityNET collaborated with Cardano and trialed AI in healthcare diagnostics with the Mayo Clinic).
* **Product Features:** Essential features include single click agent deployment, rollback, flexible, secure and customizable AI agent policies, kill switches, audit trails and on-chain controls, governance UIs, token payment rails and revenue splits, [verifiable compute, reasoning and performance](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365377903_Applying_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Cryptocurrency_Markets_A_Survey),  built-in progressive disclosure that defaults to quick launch but also offers an “expert mode” for parameter tuning, model selection and API keys for composability. No-code platform for launching AI agents that act asWeb3 AI Chatbot, Smart Contract Auditor, NFT Generator, Trading Assistant and evolve. Wealth coach that personalizes financial insights, strategies, and risk analysis. AI powered strategy marketplace, predictive analytics dashboard, cross-chain AI agent orchestration, automated compliance and reporting.
