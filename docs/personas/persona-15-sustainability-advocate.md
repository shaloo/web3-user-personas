# 15. Sustainability Steward: Sustainer Suzy

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- *Hanging in mindful suspension, seeing crypto's environmental impact from a new perspective*
  ![Sustainability Advocate (Tarot: The Hanged Man (XII))](../img/15_sustainability.webp)

- ## tl;dr

    The Sustainability Advocate promotes eco-friendly blockchain practices and proof-of-stake initiatives. Trends indicate 21% green crypto CAGR by 2030, with regulations (EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)) accelerating mindful adoption.

    - Ethical maximalist that prioritizes PoS (99% energy cut) and regenerative finance (ReFi) projects for verifiable green finance, staking/auditing as daily tasks amid limited options pain
    - Engages with on-chain carbon markets to [retire tokenized carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/retiring-carbon-credits-everything-you-need-to-know/) or purchase them and offset digital footprint/invest in climate mitigation projects
    - Consumes mindfully, prefers verifiable collaboration for ESG balance, motivated by legacy/sustainable development goals(SDGs) over hype.
    - Must have transparent trackers, PoS efficiency, DAO governance to combat green washing (0.3% GHG scrutiny)
    - Likes green interfaces with simulators, responds to communication on eco-tuned channels for investor alignment
    - Interested in [bioregional DAOs](https://prism.sustainability-directory.com/area/bioregional-oracle-dao/resource/1/)
    - Applies pressure to projects/enterprises to adopt ESG frameworks and measurable targets

- ## Characteristics

    - Environmental conscious crypto participation
    - Supports proof-of-stake and green blockchain initiatives
    - Promotes sustainable crypto practices
    - Select or move assets to low-energy networks (PoS chains) or L2s
    - Audits project claims, takes part in stewardship (education & outreach)
    - Strong aversion to the computational waste
    - Attracted to solutions that demonstrate resource optimization, measured efficiency (Algorand's 0.00017 kWh per transaction)

- ## Behavior Patterns

    - Advocates for low-energy blockchains, uses governance/forum channels to push projects towards credible sustainability practices
    - Participates in sustainability discussions
    - Verifies supply chain data via blockchain-based dashboards to check the environmental provenance of a specific product before purchasing
    - Supports green crypto projects
    - Educates on environmental impact
    - Researches/audits green projects, willing to use on-chain tools (offset tokens, PoS networks) but also looks for rigorous validation
    - Trades/Holds eco-tokens (ALGO, ADA)

- ## Pain Points

    - Energy consumption concerns
    - Limited green blockchain adoption
    - Public perception of crypto’s environmental impact

- ## Engagement

    - Sustainability-driven
    - Community-focused
    - Sharing sustainability impact metrics

- ## Primary Platforms

    - Green blockchain forums
    - Twitter/X
    - Discord sustainability channels

- ## Tech Affinity

    - Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Variants (e.g., Pure PoS, Delegated PoS), to address pain point of limited options/measurement via efficiency,transparency
    - Renewable Energy Integration and Carbon Offsetting Platforms, Carbon accounting frameworks
    - Blockchain-enabled carbon markets & tokenized carbon credits
    - Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) for Green Finance
    - Transparency & governance tooling ([ESG frameworks](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/defining-the-contours-of-a-sustainable-crypto-enterprise) for crypto firms to assess carbon footprints)
    - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) for Privacy-Preserving Sustainability Reporting
    - Decentralized Science (DeSci) and ReFi (Regenerative Finance), ReFi combats greenwashing with verifiable data

## How to Target?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-vector-difference: __Sustainability Steward Mindset__

    ---

    * *MValues-Driven Investment Philosophy ("Profit with Purpose"):* Ethical consciousness, mindfulness blended with pragmatic view of tech, views short-term gains secondary to long-term planetary health
    * *Long-term, Systems-level Thinker/Reformer:* Cares about upstream impacts (electricity mix, supply chains, hardware lifecycle) not just protocol consensus
    * *Transparency & Accountability as Non-Negotiables:* Demands verification, skeptical of hype, distrusts unproven claims, seeks ZK-proofs for emissions, has precautionary and evidence-led mindset
    * *Collaborative, Community-centric:* Believes in collective action, as in [250+ Accord members](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/cryptos-green-revolution-can-blockchain-become-sustainable) targeting net-zero by 2040
    * *Technology as Enabler of Environmental Stewardship:* Innovative optimism, sees blockchain technology as SDG enabler 
    * *Holistic ESG Integration:* Balances economic/social gains with environment

-   :material-brain: __Sustainability Steward Motivation__

    ---

    * *Environmental Legacy:* Reducing personal and community carbon footprint, reducing crypto's 120+ TWh/year footprint to protect ecosystems, as in Ethereum's Merge impact.
    * *Combating Greenwashing through Verification:* Wants transparency, credibility, provable, auditable emissions figures to back claims and investments
    * *Ethical Alignment (Finance):* Enabling green bonds/tokenization for 21% market CAGR, aligning profit with planet
    * *Community Empowerment:* Supporting DAOs for bioregional funding, aiding underserved via sustainable models
    * *Regulatory/Compliance Initiatives:* MiCA/CSRD mandates driving 96% corporate reporting, motivating verifiable tools
    * *Mitigating Climate Risk:* Motivated by the broader goal of helping to achieve global net-zero carbon emission

-   :material-rocket-launch: __Sustainability Steward Must-Have__

    ---

    * *Energy-Efficient Consensus:* PoS or equivalents (<0.5 kWh/tx) to match Ethereum's 99% reduction
    * *Transparent Impact Tracking:* Real-time dashboards with ZK-verified metrics for emissions/carbon offsets
    * *Interoperability with ESG Systems:* Seamless integration for RWAs/SDGs
    * *Anti-Greenwashing Tools:* Auditable claims via blockchain analytics to bridge the 30% green launch gap
    * *Community Governance Features:* DAO tools for eco-voting

## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Mobile and transparency-first UX, intuitive, green-themed interfaces (e.g., earthy palettes, eco-icons), simplified filters for PoS projects, interactive trackers showing personal CO2 savings, DX with low-code tools for ZK/carbon integrations, with SDKs emphasizing scalability without energy spikes ([Hedera](https://hedera.com/use-cases/sustainability)), informed CX with personalized onboarding with SDG-aligned tutorials, seamless staking flows reducing friction for ethical yields, build campaigns highlighting verified impacts, clear UX to compare network footprints & migrate assets.
* **Communication Style:** Evidence-first messaging, leverage eco-focussed technical and policy channels, partner with trusted third parties, [Southpole](https://www.southpole.com/publications/report-accounting-for-cryptocurrency-climate-impacts-publication), Cambridge, Energy Web, UN/WEF events for webinars on PoS transitions, share information on greenwashing pitfalls. Leverage carbon-aware compute as an adoption lever: offering users compute options tied to renewables or carbon credits increases trust. Communications should focus on Quantifiable Impact Metrics and frame the product as a superior, trustless solution to the failures and self-reporting issues of centralized ESG systems.
* **Product Features:** Energy consumption disclosure and PoS/Low-Energy defaults in products, carbon footprint dashboard showing network emissions, methodology, and confidence intervals, green project curator with AI-filtered PoS/RWA marketplace, verifying via ZK for anti-greenwashing, protection against greenwashing, enable Voting tools for eco-grants, appealing to community motivations, impact simulator to foster mindful engagement with scenarios showing SDG contributions, DeSci integrations, ESG compliance, ESG-linked lending/buying features for open eco-data sharing, aligning with UN blockchain calls for climate action, standards compliance and third-party audits for sustainability, integration with [dMRV](https://blog.dclimate.net/dmrv-what-is-it-how-it-works-and-why-it-is-essential-for-bringing-scale-and-accountability-to-the-vcm/) and auditability, use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to beat the greenwashing skepticism.
