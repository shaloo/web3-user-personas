## Action Plan

* **Monitor NFT Trends:** NFT cycles wax and wane rapidly. Keep a tab on the [latest NFT trading volumes](https://dappradar.com/rankings/nft/collections) to align with the popular platforms and NFT demands. For example [Q3 2025 gaming NFTs](https://dappradar.com/narratives/gaming/nfts) are trading more than other NFTs.
* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Status-first, community-centric design that emphasizes rarity indicators, collection prestige, and social signaling. Focus on visual storytelling and inclusive accessibility that attracts both new users and technically proficient users. [Interactive and animated content](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.11078) makes for a great user experience for the NFT collector persona.
* **Communication Style:** Use native, relatable but hype trend aligned terms such as 'diamond-hands', 'HODL'. Leverage scarcity psycology, FOMO tactics and mirror popular NFT Discord communication patterns as hooks. Build sustained communities and transparent leadership with well defined, evolving but shared roadmap instead of leading with short-term speculation. This helps draw on the social engagement and social identity needs of NFT collector persona.
* **Product Features:** Use a mobile first approach with advanced filtering and search to enable discovery through rarity metrics, traits, price ranges. Focus on providing real-time market Data (live floor prices, volume, trending collections) along with social proof elements (list of influencers buying/selling). Other necessary features include portfolio manager that tracks collection value, profit/loss and trading analytics along with community integration (Discord, social sharing). Also, there is potential to leverage product NFTs as a valuable promotional tool for building lasting customer relationships and sustaining brand value.
