# 5. Web3 Dev: BUIDLer Ben

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- *Pouring innovation into the digital realm, guided by the stars of technological possibility*
  ![Web3 Developer (Tarot: The Star (XVII))](../img/5_webp_builder_dev.webp)

- ## tl;dr

    The Web3 Builder/Developer persona advances innovation through blockchain infrastructure, service development, open-source contributions, and cryptographic research essential to the growth of Web3 technologies. 


    * **Sub-personas:**

        * *Infrastructure developers:* Core protocols, smart contracts, dApps
        * *Backend & frontend developers:* Connecting traditional web and blockchain
        * *Cryptographers, researchers, academics:* Leading blockchain innovation

    * **Focus areas:**

        * Multi-chain & interoperability
        * Restaking models
        * AI-integrated Web3 solutions
        * Specialized Layer-2 solutions
        * High-performance platforms (Solana, Base)

    * **Work culture:**

        * Remote work declined significantly in 2025 ([source](https://web3.career/learn-web3/web3-intelligence-report))
        * Long-term mindset, innovation-first, globally accessible, real-world impact

    * **Developer profile:**

        * Experienced devs dominate; higher churn among newcomers ([source](https://metaschool.so/articles/developers-mid-year-web3-report-2023))
        * More devs today outside of US (in Asia and elsewhere) building in Web3 than a decade ago

    * **Ecosystem priorities:**

        * Ecosystem-specific solutions attract builder attention
        * Stablecoin infrastructure and tooling are high-demand areas

- ## Characteristics

    * *Developer profile:*
        
        - Blockchain expert with 2+ years of Web3 experience
        - Contributor to open-source projects
        - Innovation- and experimentation-focused

    * *Community engagement:* 
    
        - Active in code commits, forums, and broader Web3 communities

    * *Technical focus:*

        - Developing cross-chain and NFT infrastructure
        - Integrating DeFi protocols and AI solutions
        - Addressing scaling challenges for high-throughput applications

- ## Behavior Patterns

    - Shows resilience during crypto market downturns, despite funding challenges
    - Engages actively in building infrastructure, protocols, and dApps that solve real-world issues through blockchain
    - Participates actively in hackathons
    - Consumes and provides technical education to the community
    - Engages in governance discussions and prioritizes decentralization over privacy
    - Collaborates on open-source projects with developers across the globe
    - Is driven to build skills in cutting-edge technology
    - Enjoys intellectual challenges and seeks opportunities to integrate and apply new knowledge
    - Is 30% open to remuneration in crypto
    - From of account abstraction, rollups, layer-2 scaling and wallet SDKs they are quick to jump to newer trends such as chain abstraction, restaking, AI enabled Web3 solutions
    - Adopts emerging trends quickly, shifting from [2023/24 developments](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/web3-developer-report-2023) (account abstraction, rollups, layer-2 scaling, and wallet SDKs) to newer innovations such as chain abstraction, restaking, and AI-enabled Web3 solutions

- ## Pain Points

    - Scalability, Security issues
    - User experience challenges, gas fees and throughput limits
    - Funding gaps
    - Fragmented ecosystem and tooling, rapid evolution, deprecation and emergence or new technologies
    - Lack of consistent SDK documentation, complex onboarding
    - Time consuming and expensive smart contract audits
    - Uncertain regulation and compliance

- ## Engagement Hooks

    - Project-based, builders seem to be more interested in employment than entrepreneurship
    - Long-term commitment to ecosystems, transparency
    - Hackathons, Web3 Conferences, participating in the community for intellectual and governance experiences
    - Newcomers need more hand holding, seasoned developers need intellectual challenges

- ## Primary Platforms

    * [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    * Discord dev channels
    * Twitter/X
    * Specialized forums on dev, Web3 trends, new EIPs, standards
    * EVM, non-EVM, L2 blockchains

- ## Tech Affinity

    - Smart contract development and deployment
    - Cross-chain development
    - Testing on Testnets
    - Integration with Wallet SDKs, DeFi protocols
    - Specialized Layer-2 chains
    - Learning and skill building 
    - Improving UX with modern Web3 tooling and Web2 like simplicity
    - Infrastructure libraries for onboarding, setting up new protocols, debugging tooling, AI enabled vibe coding for quickly putting together frontends and user experiences

## How to Target?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-vector-difference: __Long-term Investor Mindset__

    ---

    * Prefer long-term vision over short-term tactics when evaluating protocols and solutions
    * Quality over quantity approach
    * Robust, scalable solution preference than flashy features
    * Adaptablility to technical evolution and market uncertainty
    * Multi-ecosystem thinking
    * Global collaboration, innovation first, open-source mindset

-   :material-brain: __Long-term Investor Motivation__

    ---

    * Building real-world systems
    * Ecosystem impact and network effects (build apps that attract more users in turn attracting more devs to Web3)
    * Financial innovation leadership (decentralization, privacy, security)
    * Access to 24x7 active global markets
    * Skill development in cutting edge emerging technologies related to blockchain such as zk-proof, RWA, DePIN, dAI, self-sovereign identity, quantum-resistant blockchain protocols

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-rocket-launch: __Long-term Investor Must-Have__

    ---

    * High quality, well-documented development kits
    * Layer-2 integration and optimization tools
    * Scalability and productivity solutions
    * User experience simplification
    * Testnet access and support
    * Multi-chain mobility and compatibility
    * AI integration, high-performance infrastructure access, restaking and yield optimization tooling integration, cross-geo development support
    * Productivity tools including advanced analytics and monitoring

</div>

## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** DX first approach with clean APIs, comprehensive documentation, sample code and intuitive tooling, focus on stablility and efficiency than flashy features, start simple and allow advanced customization, design for interoperability from ground up with multi-chain native interfaces.
* **Communication Style:** Prioritize non-US geographies where blockchain development is surging, address cross-chain development needs, emphasize practical real world problem solving over speculation, target the 70% of 2+ year experienced developers, engage with technical tutorials and hands on resources, workshops, emphasize professional growth than quick financial gains, leverage developer communities and word-of-mouth recommendations.
* **Product Features:** Ensure comprehensive SDKs and APIs with excellent documentation, learning pathways, testing and development tooling, flexibility in integration, monitoring and optimization features that cater to global developer communities, ease of collaboration across geographies.
