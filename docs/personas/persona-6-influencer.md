## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Clean, mobile first, on-the-go content creation options, frictionless UX, transparency showing sponsorship status, analytics showing reach / authenticity; detection of fake followers.
* **Communication Style:** Multi-platform communication to reach influencers, educational content, case studies showing influencers using the product, transparency related to monetization, sponsorship, messaging that emphasizes early access exclusive features, ability to shape community, be first, highlight control, creativity and authenticity.
* **Product Features:** On-chain reputation badges, content optimizer (AI-enabled) and contnet scheduler, ability to cross-post, audience authenticity verification, sentiment and trend alerts, community integrations (Discord, Telegram), ROI effectiveness metrics, monetization tools such as NFT gating, affiliate links, privacy and compliance aids (disclosure automation) to reduce regulatory risk, decentralized backup and recovery against censorship.
