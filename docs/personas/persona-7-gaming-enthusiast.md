## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Fun and immersive graphic experiences, avatar customization, responsive and low latency for gameplay, especially for mobile / browser play in emerging markets. Flexible monetization paths tha enable players that just want to play, and also those that want to earn as well. Offering multiple modes (free-to-play + play-to-earn + hybrid). Guild dashboards and cross-platform interoperability.
* **Communication Style:** Engage using all community and guild channels. Leverage case stories highlighting players in similar geographies, contexts that are enjoying and gaining assets, build trust with transparency in tokenomics, publish reward breakdowns, inflation control, real player data, competitions, tournaments to engage exploratory and competitive mindset, consider regional economics and localization to reach target audience.
* **Product Features:** Robust tokenomics engine that provides sinks, burn mechanisms, dual tokens if needed, inflation control. Provide player leader boards and asset portfolio tracker, analytics, transparent game statistics, value of assets, risk metrics, social and community engagement and status display features, customizability, safety and governance transparency, audited smart contracts, clear game rules, cheating mitigation strategies. Interoperabiilty and cross-interactions with metaverse and other gaming assets is a big plus. Local regulation, taxes, crypto access are important considerations for feature prioritization. Mechanisms to lock in loyalty sustains interest longer term. Game genre matters: RPGs, virtual world/social metaverse games appear to be preferred for deeper engagement & asset collecting. Action / casual P2E has audience but lower retention.
