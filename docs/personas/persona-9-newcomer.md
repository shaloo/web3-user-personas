## Action Plan

* **Research & Refine:** Do your own research. Use this template to guide your design, documentation and product feature decisions. The lack of formal UX research reports in Web3 is a testament that this is an underexplored area where original research could provide significant competitive advantage.
* **Design Philosophy:** Mobile-first, user-centric, iterative design that evolves rapidly with user feedback and analytics. Active refinement of the user onboarding journey through analytics. Monitor where users hesitate, drop off, or encounter errors. 
* **Communication Style:** Preference for short digestible educational content, core values and not hype. Focus your messaging on the benefits of decentralization, ownership, and privacy, which are the core drivers of this audience. Active community engagement to build trust and address pain points directly. Regular AMA sessions, pinned beginner guides, verified moderator responses, peer communities matter to this audience.
* **Product Features:** Familiar login options to start with, non-custodial wallets with gas abstraction, bridge to self-custody, interactive demos and tutorials, learning with incentives, social recovery, ability to export to hardware wallets. Note that adoption patterns vary by country so tailor on-ramps and regulatory guidance by [region](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2025-global-crypto-adoption-index/).
